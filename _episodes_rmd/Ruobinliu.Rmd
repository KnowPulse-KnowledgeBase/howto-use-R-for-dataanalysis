## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
xd <- data.frame(
  x1 = c("aa","bb","cc","dd","ee",
         "ff","gg","hh","ii","jj"),
  x2 = 1:10,
  x3 = c(1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3),
  x4 = rep(c(1,2), times = 5),
  x5 = rep(1:5, times = 2),
  x6 = rep(1:5, each = 2),
  x7 = seq(5, 50, by = 5),
  x8 = log10(1:10),
  x9 = (1:10)^3,
  x10 = c(T,T,T,F,F,T,T,F,F,F)
)
xd
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(x = xd$x8, y = xd$x9)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

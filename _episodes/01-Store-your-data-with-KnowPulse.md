## Welcome to KnowPulse
KnowPulse can be used to store your raw phenotypic data; we highly recommend backing up your data regularly with KnowPulse during the growing season.

## Upload your data files 
Scroll down to the Data section, in the Phenotypic Data box, there are [Video Demonstrations](https://knowpulse.usask.ca/node/1772530) to guide you for data upload.
In these demonstration videos, you will learn the phenotypic data functionality that is available on KnowPulse.
